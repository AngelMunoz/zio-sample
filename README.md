# Zio Testing Ground

This is a simple project that uses [Zio] to test some ideas for [Perla] to run this script just install the current or LTS .NET SDK and run

- `dotnet fsi script.fsx`

Then you can type any of the following options followed by an enter

- q -> quits the script execution
- out -> copies what is currently inside the MountFileSystem (mfs) to the `./sample/out` directory
- add file -> adds a new file with a random GUID as the name and content
